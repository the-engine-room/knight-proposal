##What is this?
On behalf of the Responsible Data Forum, the engine room submitted an entry to the Knight News Challenge titled [“Responsible Data: if you’re going to do data, do it responsibly!”](https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/data/entries/responsible-data-if-you-are-going-to-do-data-do-it-responsibly).

This proposal to the Knight News Challenge is to take the Responsible Data Forum and broader program to its next stage. We currently have over 250 practitioners on our responsible data listserv who are interested in collectively solving responsible data challenges. With this support from Knight, we would like to improve the way we document and expand upon what the community has learned and developed so far. We are asking for USD 300k to support our community building and knowledge exchange efforts.

Now, we need your help to improve this idea. We have put the full text of the entry here on GitHub and we’re using hypothesis to track comments. You can add comments to any section of the text. We’d like you to suggest concrete edits to the text, or broader ideas for how to improve the proposal. [Here are instructions on how to add your comments](https://github.com/the-engine-room/in-house-technology-research/blob/master/annotation_instructions.md).

Please add your input by midnight, October 20. We’ll take all the feedback and refine the proposal to submit on October 28. If you run into any problems, please contact <maya@theengineroom.org>.

##How to contribute

###1. Comment and annotate

Just select any part of the text and leave your comment in the sidebar. You'll also be able to see where others have commented, and respond to their comments. We are using the amazing [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/) plugin for commenting. You'll need to create a hypothes.is account to save your comment: [we trust hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/principles/) to treat your data responsibly, and you can sign in pseudonimously as well.

###2. File issues, fork the repo, make changes, and send us a pull request

For the more tech-savvy users: you can use all the usual Github collaborative development techniques. Fork, branch, push, pull, spoon (maybe don't spoon). There are many good tutorials for using git and Github, [like this one](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).

###3. Contact us

Prefer to do it the old fashioned way? We got you covered. Just send an email to contact AT responsibledata DOT io.

#Tech specs
________________________

Do you like how we built this site? We think it's pretty nifty. Here's the rundown of the tech we're using, if you want to roll your own similar project.

###Markdown and Jekyll

All the content is organized and categorized in [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) files, using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to automatically build the HTML structure.

###Template

We're using [Byron Ruth's](https://github.com/bruth) [Jekyll Docs Template](http://bruth.github.io/jekyll-docs-template) for the structure of the website, that we customized and styled to fit our needs. The template is very well documented and has step-by-step instructions on how to install and use it.

Thanks, Byron!

###Commenting and annotation

The impressive [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/). A breeze to install, just add a single line of code to your pages:

	<script async defer src="//hypothes.is/embed.js"></script>

Hypothes.is takes care of everything else. They also have browser plugins, bookmarklets, and a Wordpress plugin.

###File editing

We recommend [prose.io](http://prose.io/) for editing the markdown files directly in your browser. You link it to your Github account, and prose.io lets you easily edit files with a clean and minimal interface. No need to download or install anything. Prose.io is developed and maintained by the great people at [Development Seed](http://developmentseed.org/).

##Enjoy.

We're looking forward to your comments and contributions and hope this document will be useful for your work.
