##How to contribute

###1. Comment and annotate

Just select any part of the text and leave your comment in the sidebar. You'll also be able to see where others have commented, and respond to their comments. We are using the amazing [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/) plugin for commenting. You'll need to create a hypothes.is account to save your comment: [we trust hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/principles/) to treat your data responsibly, and you can sign in pseudonimously as well.

###2. File issues, fork the repo, make changes, and send us a pull request

For the more tech-savvy users: you can use all the usual Github collaborative development techniques. Fork, branch, push, pull, spoon (maybe don't spoon). There are many good tutorials for using git and Github, [like this one](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).

###3. Contact us

Prefer to do it the old fashioned way? We got you covered. Just send an email to contact AT responsibledata DOT io.

#Tech specs
________________________

Do you like how we built this site? We think it's pretty nifty. Here's the rundown of the tech we're using, if you want to roll your own similar project.

###Markdown and Jekyll

All the content is organized and categorized in [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) files, using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to automatically build the HTML structure.

###Template

We're using [Byron Ruth's](https://github.com/bruth) [Jekyll Docs Template](http://bruth.github.io/jekyll-docs-template) for the structure of the website, that we customized and styled to fit our needs. The template is very well documented and has step-by-step instructions on how to install and use it.

Thanks, Byron!

###Commenting and annotation

The impressive [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/). A breeze to install, just add a single line of code to your pages:

	<script async defer src="//hypothes.is/embed.js"></script>

Hypothes.is takes care of everything else. They also have browser plugins, bookmarklets, and a Wordpress plugin.

###File editing

We recommend [prose.io](http://prose.io/) for editing the markdown files directly in your browser. You link it to your Github account, and prose.io lets you easily edit files with a clean and minimal interface. No need to download or install anything. Prose.io is developed and maintained by the great people at [Development Seed](http://developmentseed.org/).

##Enjoy.

We're looking forward to your comments and contributions and hope this document will be useful for your work.
