On behalf of the Responsible Data Forum, the engine room submitted an entry to the Knight News Challenge titled “Responsible Data: if you’re going to do data, do it responsibly!”. 

This proposal to the Knight News Challenge is to take the Responsible Data Forum and broader program to its next stage. We currently have over 250 practitioners on our responsible data listserv who are interested in collectively solving responsible data challenges. With this support from Knight, we would like to improve the way we document and expand upon what the community has learned and developed so far. We are asking for USD 300k to support our community building and knowledge exchange efforts. 

Now, we need your help to improve this idea. We have put the full text of the entry here on GitHub and we’re using hypothesis to track comments. You can add comments to any section of the text. We’d like you to suggest concrete edits to the text, or broader ideas for how to improve the proposal. Here are instructions on how to add your comments. 

Please add your input by midnight, October 20. We’ll take all the feedback and refine the proposal to submit on October 28. If you run into any problems, please contact Maya Richman. 

Thank you for your input!

- Danna, Kristin, Maya and the rest of the responsible data team
